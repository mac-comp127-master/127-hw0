Comp 127 - Homework #0
===

# Overview

The goal of this homework is to familiarize you with the development environment you will be using in this class, including VS Code, JUnit, Git and GitHub.

You will correct a simple class that incorrectly calculates the area of two shapes: a square and a circle.
Although the programming in this project is not challenging, the setup of your development tools may be.
You will often encounter an unexpected challenge or two when learning a new technology!

### Set up the assignment

1. Make sure you have completed the [Installfest instructions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RJuwG1kIlrMOu8zurt7vIXsyJJwpuaTZSJqE8J6R_sc/edit#).
1. Follow the steps in the [“Start the assignment” section](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zbYG1SOJvar52_XmtKRq0yOuDNIHS5jjaDn8Rz3_m7Y/edit#) of the Homework / Lab Procedures document.

### Run the tests (they should fail)

1. Open the project in VS Code.
1. Press command-shift-P (macOS) or ctrl-shift-P (Windows) and search for the command called **Java: Run All Tests**. Run it.
1. JUnit will run the tests. You should see a test results window that shows two failed tests.
1. Click on a test to see its error message.

### Fix the Area class

1. Open `src / edu / macalester` → `Area.java`.
1. Fix one of the two lines marked `TODO` in `Area.java`. (You may **not** change AreaTest.java.)
1. Rerun the unit tests. Look for a green “Passed” next to each of the two tests.
1. If the tests do not all pass yet, go to step 1.
1. Remove the `TODO` comments.

### Submit your work

Follow the steps in the [“Save your progress with a commit” and “Submit the assignment by pushing”](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zbYG1SOJvar52_XmtKRq0yOuDNIHS5jjaDn8Rz3_m7Y/edit#bookmark=id.ok7hybpqu919) sections of the homework procedure document.
